JavaScript &amp; the DOM
To-Do List
## Reflection
I decided I wanted to make a to-do list where the user can input tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. I also thought it would be a cool idea to change the original "My" in the heading to the user's name. I originally wanted to find a way to add a "line-through" text decoration on the inputted task, but after a while of trying, I settled on creating a button that changes color to green and the text on it to saying "completed." This was to let the user keep track of the completed tasks. This assignment definitely could be tweaked for better CSS.
## How to Use
Enter your name in the form and press "submit"
Enter a task you would like to create and press "submit"
Check off tasks and delete them
