JavaScript &amp; the DOM
To-Do List
## Reflection
I decided I wanted to make a to-do list where the user can input tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. I also thought it would be a cool idea to change the original "My" in the heading to the user's name. "My Tasks" container I added a button that changes color to green and the text on it to saying "completed" and a delete button. This was to let the user keep track of the completed tasks or delete the task if it was a mistake. This assignment definitely could be tweaked for better CSS.
## How to Use
- Enter your name in the form and press "submit"
- Enter a task you would like to create and press "submit"
- Check off tasks and delete them
